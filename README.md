I'm a self-taught Front-end Web Developer and Freelancer having expertise in
Vanilla JavaScript | Tailwindcss | Webpack | Postcss | HTML5 | CSS3.
And I build custom Websites using core languages, neither Frameworks nor CMS based softwares.   

I've built some projects to demonstrate my skill, check project section of my linkedIn profile  or you can see it on my published GitHub repo.

Businesses and Web agencies can outsource their work to me, I will deliver a quality work in time.

I'm a single person doing Freelancing not agency.
I do not outsource further, from start to finish every single thing I do my self.
So privacy wouldn't be a problem, you don't need to worry about your Data, you can trust me blindly.

There are few fields in which I will not work like:

 - If your business is about any type of alcohol thing.
 - If your business is about pig.
 - If your business is about interest.
 - If your business is about short dresses for women.
 - If you need to put such things (described above) as data or image in your website.

The reason is that I'm a Muslim and these are not allowed in our religion (Islam).
