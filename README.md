I'm a self-taght Front-end Web Developer and Freelancer having expertise in   
vanilla JavaScript | Tailwindcss | Webpack | Postcss | HTML5 | CSS3.   
And I build custom Websites using core languages, neither Frameworks nor CMS based softwares.   

Businesses and Web agencies can outsource their work to me, I will deliver a quality work in time.  

I've built some projects to demostrate my skill and you can see it on my published Github repo.   
Here is the link: https://bittechdeveloper.github.io/

I'm a single person doing Freelancing not agency.   
I do not outsource further, from start to finish every single thing I do my self.   
So privacy wouldn't be a problem, you don't need to worry about your Data, you can trust me blindly.   

There are few fields in which I will not work like:   
- if your busines is about any type of alcohal thing.
- if your business is about pig.
- if your business is about interest.
- if your business is about short dresses for wemen.
- If you need to put such things (described above) as data or image in your website.

The reason is that I'm a muslim and these are not allowed in our religion (Islam).
